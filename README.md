# SalesAnalysis
 
This project is an attempt to analyse and answer five business questions about sales data collected for 12 months using Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib libraries.

The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date and Pruchase Address.

The analysis aids in answering the following questions:

- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most and why?

It has been completed as per Keith Galli's tutorial:
